  <hl>Welcome to Liam's Programming Portfolio</hl>
  
  <p> This website was created for the CSC106 course in order to hold all of the projects, coding, and 
    other coursework that we will be writing and creating over the course of the semester. The webpage will also 
    be updated constantly as we learn new techniques.
